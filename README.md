## Description

PyLith is an open-source finite-element code for dynamic and
quasistatic simulations of crustal deformation, primarily earthquakes
and volcanoes.

## Features

* Quasi-static (implicit) and dynamic (explicit) time-stepping
* Cell types include triangles, quadrilaterals, hexahedra, and tetrahedra
* Linear elastic, linear and generalized Maxwell viscoelastic, power-law viscoelastic, and Drucker-Prager elastoplastic materials
* Infinitesimal and small strain elasticity formulations
* Fault interfaces using cohesive cells
  * Prescribed slip with multiple, potentially overlapping earthquake ruptures and aseismic creep
  * Spontaneous slip with slip-weakening friction and Dieterich rate- and state-friction fault constitutive models
* Time-dependent Dirichlet (displacement/velocity) boundary conditions
* Time-dependent Neumann (traction) boundary conditions
* Time-dependent point forces
* Absorbing boundary conditions
* Gravitational body forces
* VTK and HDF5/Xdmf output of solution, fault information, and state variables
* Templates for adding your own bulk rheologies, fault constitutive models, and interfacing with a custom seismic velocity model.
* User-friendly computation of static 3-D Green's functions
